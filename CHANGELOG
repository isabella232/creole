-----------------
OLD CVS CHANGELOG
-----------------

2006-01-30 21:32  sethr

	* Discovered that extra single quotes were being added to strings
	  due to the escape function - changed it so it does nothing, and
	  removed the calls to it from this file.

	  No escaping of single quotes is needed becuase data values are
	  inserted via OCI_BIND - there are no special characters when
	  using oci_bind.

2006-01-17 20:06  hlellelid

	* Added support for specifying any of the supported compatibility
	  flags from DSN

2006-01-17 19:44  hlellelid

	* Added new COMPAT_ constants to Creole class and changed behavior
	  to not automatically enable compatability mode.

2006-01-12 23:58  hlellelid

	* Changed MSSQL to use SCOPE_IDENTITY() instead of @@Identity, as per
	  suggestion from Randy Syring

2006-01-06 00:02  sethr

	* OCI8: Fixed an issue with the reporting of Indexes - only indexes whose
	  name matched a column name would properly report which columns
	  were involved in the index.  This change was prompted by Jens
	  Bohrmann <jbohrmann@gmail.com>

2005-12-10 13:46  hlellelid

	* Change MySQL driver to use mysql_real_escape_string()

2005-11-21 17:53  sethr

	* OCI8: Added a setnull function to fix a problem caused by interaction
	  problems with the common setnull function and oracle bind -
	  binding NULL to a number causes an invalid number error - so
	  replace nulls with ''

2005-11-13 01:29  gamr

	* Add caching of replaceParams to prepared statements

2005-11-08 04:24  hlellelid

	* Added support for sequences in PostgreSQL metadata classes

2005-11-01 01:52  hlellelid

	* Added support for identity columns to MSSQL metadata.

2005-10-18 11:20  hlellelid

	* Applied patch from Sönke Ruempler to include ON DELETE / ON
	  UPDATE for MySQL foreign key metadata.

2005-10-18 02:27  hlellelid

	* Applying sqlite patches from aurelian to fix missing $lastQuery
	  setting and have better pkey detection.

2005-10-17 19:05  dlawson_mi

	* TableMap::hasColumn() would fail sometimes if the ColumnMaps
	  hadn't been loaded yet.
	* Fixed bug with new cached Connection code: If a retrieved
	  Connection is closed, a subsequent call to
	  Creole::getConnection() with the same DSN will return the cached
	  Connection in a closed state.

2005-10-06 17:16  sethr

	* Added a setDate function to make Creole::Date save correctly in
	  Oracle.  The function is almost identical to the existing setTime
	  function

2005-09-28 13:18  hlellelid

	* Changed BIGINT to use String methods rather than integer (since
	  PHP does not support big integers)

2005-09-16 13:09  hlellelid

	* Added support for new  PHP 5.1 strtotime() signature (returns
	  FALSE now instead of -1).

2005-08-23 23:07  sethr

	* OCI8: Made changes so that inserts and updates into lob fields works
	  correctly.  Added a new array to store the columns referenced in
	  the insert/update statement.	Added a new function to determine
	  the columns referenced... This works for the tests that I have
	  done, but probably will not work for all situations Added code to
	  the sqlToOracleBindVars to put empty_*lob() inplace of a bind
	  variable, and to add a returning statement to the end of the sql.

2005-08-18 15:26  hlellelid

	* Added a DebugConnection example written by Michael Sims

2005-07-21 21:43  sethr

	* OCI8: Made some changes to make timestamps work correctly. Had to first
	  modify the connection to set the oracle session environment
	  variable NLS_DATE_FORMAT, and then added a setTimestamp function.

2005-06-13 01:56  hlellelid

	* Patch from David Zulke to make getConnection() behave like a
	  singleton, returning existing Connection (for same params).

2005-04-21 14:48  hlellelid

	* Postgres: Fixed name of primary key to be the column name of the
	  pkey (not sure if this is correct, but seems better than the empty
	  pkey name that was resulting before).



Creole 1.0.2 - April 17, 2005
-----------------------------

2005-04-16 15:55:28 hlellelid

	* Adding timezone information to the PgSQLPreparedstatement setTime()
	and setTimestamp() method so that now Creole supports the 'with time zone'
	columns in Postgres.

2005-04-16 13:27 hlellelid

	*  Reverted PreparedStatementCommon->executeQuery() to previous signature
	which supports first param being FETCHMODE.

2005-04-02 11:17 dlawson_mi

	* Optimized caching in ODBCCachedResultSet.
	* Added support for manual row counting in ODBCResultSet. This is helpful
	  for ODBC drivers which don't return a valid count when odbc_num_rows()
	  is called after a query.


Creole 1.0.1 - Apr. 07, 2005
----------------------------

2005-03-29 08:44  gamr

	* slight rework in PreparedStatementCommon to save memory
	* complete rewrite of sql parser in PreparedStatementCommon,
	  10% faster parsing

2005-03-09 14:15  hlellelid

	* Fixed bug in PgSQLTableInfo index query.

2005-03-01 07:29  micha

	* MySQLTableInfo: Fixed bugs in initForeignKeys():
	  - renamed TableInfo to MySQLTableInfo
	  - added $this->database as first parameter of MySQLTableInfo
	  - changed second parameter to $ftbl

2005-02-25 10:47  pachanga

	* vendor specific optional data attribute added to ColumnInfo,
	  DatabaseInfo, ForeignKeyInfo, PrimaryKeyInfo classes, this
	  information can be set in constructor and retrived with
	  getVendorSpecificInfo() method

2005-02-21 11:48  pachanga

	* initial tests for MySQL metadata added: tests for indexes, uniques,
	  foreign keys, vendor specific metadata
	* MySQL escaping added to all metadata retrieval classes
	* MySQL index metadata retrieval fixes(this information was loaded
	  improperly)
	* isAutoIncrement attribute added to CoumnInfo, set from
	  constructor, null by default
	* isUnique attribute added to IndexInfo, set from constructor,
	  false by default
	* vendorSpecificInfo attribute added to
	  IndexInfo, set from constructor, empty array by default
	* TableInfo can retrieve vendor specific info via getVendorSpecificInfo()
	  method
	* MySQL creole-schema.sql modified, added tables for better indexes,
	  uniques, foreign keys and vendor specific data tests

2005-02-10 04:22  pachanga

	* MySql 'longtext' field support added

2005-01-21 14:13  hlellelid

2004-12-04 00:58  gamr

	* Added PgSQLResultSetIterator class

2004-12-04 00:41  gamr

	* Removed deprecated reference to pg_cmdtuples.

2004-12-04 00:29  gamr

	* Removed deprecated use of pg_exec.

2004-12-03 11:54  gamr

	* speed optimized SQLiteResultSetIterator (20%+)

2004-12-03 11:28  gamr

	* SQLiteResultSetIterator: fix the valid() function in the iterator
	  so we have all of our rows, it was skipping a row every time it was
	  called

2004-11-29 08:41  micha

	* SQLiteResultSet: Fixed unknown variable $this->conn->connection
	  ($this->conn->getResource())

	  Submitted By: Tony Bibbs

2004-11-28 11:21  hlellelid

	* Added implementation of initForeignKeys() for supported versions of
	  MySQL.

	  Submitted By: Tony Bibbs

2004-11-18 16:35  dlawson_mi

	* ODBCPreparedStatement: Added ability to emulate prepared statements
	  if necessary. This is triggered by a function in ODBCAdapter.

2004-11-04 13:51  revjim

	* [Jargon] Altered all referenced of CONSTANTS in Record to use proper
	  namespaces (i.e. UPDATE becomes Record::UPDATE) in order to remove
	  E_NOTICE errors and provide proper operation (as the default is to
	  interpret the constant as a string).

2004-11-04 13:42  revjim

	* [Jargon] Altered all calls to "is_a" to use the new "instanceof"
	  conditional so that code will execute properly under E_STRICT.

2004-10-25 21:42  hlellelid

	* Changed setTimestamp() so that it escapes the value before inserting.
